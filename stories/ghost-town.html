        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>The abandoned mining town of Prosperity sits silent in the desert heat, its empty buildings a testament to forgotten dreams. You've come here as a curious explorer, drawn by rumors of strange occurrences and the town's mysterious overnight abandonment decades ago.</p>
          
          <p>Standing at the edge of Main Street, you take in the eerie stillness. Not even insects disturb the quiet. The buildings—a general store, saloon, hotel, and various shops—stand frozen in time, their windows dark and uninviting.</p>
          
          <p>As you consider where to begin your exploration, a sudden breeze kicks up dust from the empty street, swirling it in a pattern that almost seems deliberate—like a finger beckoning you forward.</p>

          <p>Behind the bar, bottles of liquor stand untouched, their labels faded with time. A thick layer of dust covers everything, undisturbed for decades—except for one spot.</p>
          
          <p>On the bar counter, a single playing card lies face up—the ace of spades—its surface mysteriously clean and pristine. As you approach it, the temperature in the room drops noticeably.</p>
          
          <p>Something flickers in your peripheral vision, like a distortion in the air. A whisper seems to come from everywhere and nowhere: "<em>They're coming back tonight. With the mist. Like they always do.</em>"</p>

          <p>The town hall stands as the most imposing building in Prosperity, its stone façade weathered but intact. The heavy wooden doors are unlocked, swinging open with a mournful groan.</p>
          
          <p>Inside, the main hall is dominated by rows of wooden benches facing a raised platform. Dust sheets cover what might be a podium. The walls are lined with faded photographs showing the town in its heyday—miners, families, celebrations.</p>
          
          <p>A side door leads to administrative offices. Papers are strewn across the floor, as if someone had been searching frantically through files. A calendar on the wall is stopped at June 1953, the day circled in red ink with no explanation.</p>
          
          <p>As you examine the scattered documents, a door down the hallway slowly swings shut with a loud click. The sound of filing cabinet drawers opening and closing echoes from the room beyond, though you can see no one there.</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>"Who are 'they'?" you ask, your voice steady despite your racing heart.</p>
          
          <p>The ghost—for what else could it be—materializes more fully. A weathered man in his fifties, with a handlebar mustache and a dealer's visor. His form flickers like a faulty projection.</p>
          
          <p>"The miners," he says, his voice distant yet clear. "They found something deep in the earth. Something old. Something hungry."</p>
          
          <p>He gestures toward a chair. When you hesitate, he smiles sadly. "I ain't gonna hurt you. Been thirty years since I had someone to talk to."</p>
          
          <p>You carefully sit, keeping the ace of spades in your hand. The ghost nods approvingly.</p>
          
          <p>"Name's Sullivan. I ran the tables here when Prosperity was a mining boom town. That night... they came up from the mines covered in some kind of mist, eyes black as coal. Moved funny, like puppets. Started taking people."</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's form wavers, emotions distorting his appearance. "Mayor ordered evacuation, but it was chaos. That mist... it followed people. Consumed them. Changed them."</p>
          
          <p>He points toward the window. "The ones that got changed, they left. Hunting. Spreading. But they come back sometimes. When the mist rises."</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan leans closer, his ghostly eyes intense. "You need to leave before sunset. But first... would you do an old ghost a favor? My lucky deck is still hidden in my room upstairs. With all the cards together, I might finally be able to move on."</p>

          <p>The temperature plummets further. Your breath billows in front of you as frost forms on the bottles behind the bar.</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Wait, please!</em>" The ghostly voice rises in pitch, tinged with desperation. "<em>I've been alone so long!</em>"</p>
          
          <p>The air shimmers and the spectral form of a man in old-fashioned clothes materializes more fully—a poker dealer with a handlebar mustache and haunted eyes.</p>
          
          <p>"Name's Sullivan," he says, his form flickering like a bad television signal. "I ain't gonna hurt you. Just... tired of being alone all these years."</p>
          
          <p>You edge toward the door, but Sullivan's ghost drifts to block your path, his expression pleading.</p>

          <p>Something crashes upstairs—a heavy thud followed by the sound of slow, dragging footsteps.</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's expression turns to horror. "They're still here," he whispers. "Hiding in the buildings. Waitin' for the mist to return."</p>
          
          <p>The footsteps grow louder, descending toward the saloon floor. Sullivan's ghost flickers urgently.</p>
          
          <p>"Quick! You've got to hide—or run. Once they catch your scent, they won't stop hunting you."</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>You move cautiously down the hallway toward the source of the sounds. The floorboards creak beneath your feet, impossibly loud in the dusty silence. The door at the end of the hall stands slightly ajar, light spilling through the crack.</p>
          
          <p>As you approach, the sounds suddenly stop. You pause, listening intently. Nothing but the soft whisper of your own breathing.</p>
          
          <p>Slowly, you push the door open to reveal the mayor's office—a spacious room with a large oak desk dominating the center. Unlike the rest of the building, this room appears to have been recently disturbed. The desk drawers hang open, and several file boxes have been emptied onto the floor.</p>
          
          <p>A shaft of afternoon sunlight slants through the dusty window, illuminating particles floating in the air. They move strangely, not in the random patterns of dust motes, but in swirling, deliberate shapes.</p>
          
          <p>On the desk sits an old typewriter with a sheet of paper still loaded in it. The text is clearly visible:</p>
          
          <p>"<em>EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ENACTED. QUARANTINE PERIMETER ESTABLISHED. ALL CIVILIAN PERSONNEL TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY. ANY INDIVIDUALS SHOWING SYMPTOMS ARE TO BE...</em>"</p>
          
          <p>The rest of the page is blank, as if the typist had been interrupted mid-sentence.</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>Ignoring the eerie sounds from down the hall, you kneel and begin sifting through the scattered papers on the floor. Most are mundane administrative documents—budgets, permits, meeting minutes—but a few catch your eye.</p>
          
          <p>One folder is labeled "Prosperity Mining Co. - INCIDENT REPORTS" in red ink. Opening it reveals geological surveys and hastily written field notes.</p>
          
          <p>One report stands out, dated just days before the town's abandonment:</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Shaft 7 breakthrough exposes unusual cavity. Estimated age: pre-human. Hieroglyphics unlike any known language. Air samples show trace elements not on periodic table. Request immediate scientific team.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>Attached is a photograph showing miners standing before a massive dark opening. Their expressions are uneasy, and one figure in the back appears blurred, as if moving.</p>
          
          <p>A follow-up report, written the next day in shaky handwriting:</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Miller and Dawson exhibiting unusual symptoms after exposure to cave atmosphere. Pupils dilated, skin pallor, decreased responsiveness. Dr. Harris recommends quarantine. Foreman overruled, says we're behind schedule.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>The final document is a telegram from the State Health Department: "<em>URGENT. SEAL MINE IMMEDIATELY. CONTAINMENT TEAM EN ROUTE. EVACUATE TOWN. DO NOT ALLOW EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS TO LEAVE AREA.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>As you read, the temperature in the room drops noticeably. A soft hissing sound comes from the vents along the floor—like whispering voices. Looking down, you notice a thin tendril of mist seeping into the room.</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>"I'll help you find your deck," you tell Sullivan, whose ghostly form brightens with hope.</p>
          
          <p>"Thank you kindly," he says, leading you toward a narrow staircase behind the bar. "Second door on the right. That was my room."</p>
          
          <p>The stairs creak ominously under your weight. Upstairs, a narrow hallway stretches into darkness, doors lining both sides. You count to the second door on the right and find it slightly ajar.</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's room is small but was once comfortable. A bed with a metal frame sits against one wall, a simple dresser opposite it. A small table by the window still holds an oil lamp and what looks like a half-written letter.</p>
          
          <p>"In the floorboard under the bed," Sullivan instructs, hovering anxiously. "Loose plank."</p>
          
          <p>You kneel beside the bed, finding the loose board easily. Prying it up reveals a small cavity containing a velvet pouch.</p>
          
          <p>Inside is most of a deck of cards, ornately designed with silver edges now tarnished with age.</p>
          
          <p>"That's it!" Sullivan exclaims, his form becoming more solid as you combine the ace of spades with the rest of the deck. "My lucky deck. Won it from a traveling magician who said it was enchanted. Never believed him until... well, until I died and it kept me tethered here."</p>
          
          <p>As the complete deck rests in your hands, a sense of peace comes over Sullivan's features. "One last favor," he says softly. "Deal me a final hand. A proper send-off."</p>
          
          <p>You sit at the small table and deal five cards face down. Sullivan watches with anticipation.</p>
          
          <p>"Turn 'em over," he whispers.</p>
          
          <p>You flip the cards: a royal flush in spades. Sullivan's ghost laughs in delight.</p>
          
          <p>"Perfect," he says, already beginning to fade. "Now I can rest. But you need to leave town before dark. The mist is rising tonight—I can feel it. They'll be coming."</p>
          
          <p>His form grows transparent, but his voice remains clear: "The mine is at the north end of town. That's where it started. That's where you'll find answers—but I wouldn't go there if I were you."</p>
          
          <p>With a final nod of gratitude, Sullivan's ghost dissolves into motes of light that swirl briefly before dissipating completely.</p>
          
          <p>Through the window, you notice the sun is getting low. And in the distance, at the north end of town, an unnatural fog is beginning to form.</p>
